			<p>Jennie Kim was born in the Seoul Capital Area, South Korea on January 16, 1996, and is her family's only child.[2][3][4] When Jennie was eight years old, she went on a trip with her family to Australia and New Zealand. While they were in New Zealand, her mother asked her if she liked the place and if she wanted to stay, Jennie replied "yes" without knowing the outcome ahead, as she was only a child. A year later, she was sent alone abroad to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland, New Zealand and lived with a home-stay family.[5] In 2006, Jennie appeared in MBC’s special documentary "English, Must Change to Survive" she spoke about her experiences in learning a new language.[6] It was shown in the documentary that Jennie's left arm was broken and in a cast. In a V Live, Jennie explained that while carrying her $2 drink she had tripped and broken her arm by putting out her hand to save it from dropping because she received only $5 per week allowance.[7] During her adolescent years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer.[8]</p>

			<p>After graduating middle school she transferred to ACG Parnell College.[5] She had heard a lot about K-pop while residing in New Zealand and managed to find a particular interest in the music of YG Entertainment.[9] Her mother was planning to transfer her to Florida, United States at the age of 14 so she could become a lawyer or teacher, but Jennie had called her mother crying on the phone, opposing of her wishes. Jennie thought she might not be able to find work she liked residing alone in Florida, her family fully supported her decision and she moved back to South Korea.[10][9] Jennie participated in an audition held by YG Entertainment that same year and performed Rihanna's "Take A Bow". She later succeeded in joining the label as a trainee.[11] Jennie told High Cut Korea that she was so afraid of strangers and terrible at taking the initiative to be funny, that she could barely say "Hello" during her audition.[12] Jennie initially auditioned as a vocalist, but the company thought she should be a rapper instead since she was the only trainee capable of speaking English, and most of the songs she covered included raps.[13][14] She attended Cheongdam Middle School and Chungdam High School during her trainee days.[15]</p>
